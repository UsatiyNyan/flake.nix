    # 1. Set {option}`boot.loader.systemd-boot.edk2-uefi-shell.enable` to `true`

    # 3. Reboot and select "EDK2 UEFI Shell" from the systemd-boot menu

    # 5. For each device handle (for example, `HD0c1`), run `ls HD0c1:\EFI`
    # 6. If the output contains the directory `Microsoft`, you might have found the correct device handle
    # 7. Run `HD0c1:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi` to check if Windows boots correctly
    # 8. If it does, this device handle is the one you need (in this example, `HD0c1`)
